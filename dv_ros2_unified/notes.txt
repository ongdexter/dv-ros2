Objectives:
	1. make a container node
	2. add a modified, composable capture node to the container
	3. make a ros2 composable wrapper node for evflownet
	4. test everything together with real/recorded inputs


Remarks:

		b. removing main() definitions, as execution is moved to executor in the container node
		c. updating launch configs (here I use .launch.py files), i.e. re-writing the script to ensure proper param-passing and enable IPC
		d. ???

Instructions:
	1. To load an easy component:
